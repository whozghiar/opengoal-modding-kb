# Lisp wiki — Jak 3 specifics

What differs in Jak 3. Read [common.md](common.md) first: only real differences live here. Index: [index.md](index.md).

## 4.1 Dark Jak stages (`darkjak-stage` bitfield)

Dark Jak capabilities are driven by the `darkjak-stage` bitfield enum in
`target-h.gc`, stored in `(-> self darkjak stage)` and
`(-> self darkjak want-stage)`:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `active` | Base Dark Jak form. |
| `bomb0` / `bomb1` | Dark Bomb / Dark Blast. |
| `invinc` | Invulnerability. |
| `invis` | Invisibility (suppresses offensive stages). |
| `tracking` | Target tracking. |
| `smack` | Dark Strike. |
| `giant` | Scaling stage flag. |

Entry validation: `want-to-darkjak?` / `want-to-powerjak?` (in
`target-darkjak.gc` / `target-lightjak.gc`) check the
`(game-feature darkjak)` flag in `*setting-control*`, focus tests, and
timing. Transformed movement uses `*darkjak-trans-mods*` surface
parameters. The Jak 3 engine still carries the Jak 2 "Dark Giant"
animation `jakb-darkjak-get-on-fast-ja` and the scale-interp var
`(-> self darkjak-giant-interp)` as a legacy leftover.

## 4.2 Secrets menu (`game-secrets`)

Secrets and cheats are tracked by the `game-secrets` bitfield enum in
`settings-h.gc`, persisted in `(-> *game-info* secrets)`.

```lisp
(logtest? (game-secrets <flag>) (-> *game-info* secrets))
```

Menu entries are `secret-item-option` instances in static arrays like
`*menu-secrets-array*` (`secrets-menu.gc`). Custom/unlocalized labels are
mapped dynamically during option rendering in `progress-draw-pc.gc`.

## 4.3 Powers/weapons interplay

Modifying `*target*` states can disrupt weapon transitions (`gun-states`)
and power transitions (`light-jak` / `dark-jak`). Test both after any
`target` change.

## 4.4 Weapon system (`gun`)

```lisp
;; weapon state, ammo and morph are read through the player process
(when *target*
  (let ((gun (-> *target* gun)))
    ;; access firing modes, ammo counts, morph attachments
    ))
```

## 4.5 Custom art-groups: no dynamic linking hook

Unlike Jak 1 and Jak 2 ([1.2.8](common.md#128-custom-art-groups--dynamic-animation-linking-link-art)),
Jak 3's engine code has no `register-custom-art-group` / `link-art!` /
`needs-link?` hook. Build a self-contained art-group instead
(`build-actor` without `:master-art-group`), or attach the entity through
`target-set-lod`-style skeleton swapping if it must ride on Jak/Daxter's
own skeleton (see the `custom-actors-levels` skill for the general asset
pipeline).

## 4.6 Memory

Kernel entry: `goal_src/jak3/kernel/gcommon.gc`,
`goal_src/jak3/engine/level/level.gc`. Jak 3 ships the PC memory
extension:

```lisp
;; goal_src/jak3/kernel/gcommon.gc
(defconstant END_OF_MEMORY #x20000000)     ;; 512 MB

;; goal_src/jak3/engine/level/level.gc
(defconstant DEBUG_LEVEL_HEAP_MULT 15.0)   ;; already the highest tested of the three games
```
